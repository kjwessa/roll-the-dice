This project is called **Roll the Dice** and is a simple game where two players roll dice, first to 100 wins!

### Game Begin

It features:

1. Rolling dice that increases the user's current score
2. Rolling a 1 will reset the user's current score
3. Users can choose to hold their score (safer) or proceed and risk losing their rolls
4. Changing UI when a user wins

In future iterations, I want to...

- (UX) Make the game mobile responsive (UX)
- (UX) Remove the roll/hold dice buttons once the game is completed
- (Accessibility) Switch from PX to REM
- (Brand) Create a game logo and favicon
- (Fun) Allow users to change the default winning score of 100 to something else
- (Fun) Allow users to change their names from the default values
- (Fun) Create logic that penalizes players for going too far over 100
